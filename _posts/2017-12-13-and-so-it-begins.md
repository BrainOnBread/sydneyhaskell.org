Howdy Folks;

31 people are registered for tonight's study group. I can't believe it.

As a reminder - there won't be any food or drink nor will there be any talks/lectures. This is a study group, so make sure you turn up with your laptop and be prepared to do some reading and light exercises. If you already know Haskell, you are also welcome to participate and help others get up to speed.
