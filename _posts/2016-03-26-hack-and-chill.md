Today 25 haskellers gathered together to spend a Saturday afternoon to chat about Haskell and code in Haskell. Some folks worked on their own projects, or studied specific aspects of the languages, and plenty of beginners were working through the [haskell book](http://haskellbook.com/) together.

In the last hour, a few fine folks gave lightning talks: 

Hector talked about his project [PTCPD server project](https://github.com/HectorAE/ptcpd), which is a server-side PTCP component in Haskell that can host a plain text chat network. He got the crowd to participate in chatting on his demo network!

Libby mentioned the web tool she uses for her work at [PositionDev](http://positiondev.com/), which generated a lively discussion about Haskell web frameworks.

Kat mentioned this [ny-haskell.org](http://ny-haskell.org) website, and welcomed everyone in the group to contribute pull requests via github. ([http://github.com/ny-haskell/ny-haskell.org](http://github.com/ny-haskell/ny-haskell.org))

Many thanks to our generous host for the day, [PositionDev](http://positiondev.com/)!
